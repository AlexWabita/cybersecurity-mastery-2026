# Cybersecurity Mastery 2026 🔐

This repository is my **public learning journal** as I deliberately grow from a complete cybersecurity beginner into a skilled, ethical, and job-ready cybersecurity professional.

Nothing here is theoretical fluff. Every folder, script, and write-up represents something I **learned, tested, broke, fixed, and truly understood**.

This is not a sprint. It’s a disciplined, intentional journey.

## Why This Repository Exists

I learn best by **doing**, not memorizing. Instead of jumping between random tutorials, I chose to document my cybersecurity journey through:

- Hands-on labs and simulations  
- Real tools used by cybersecurity professionals  
- Custom scripts and automation I build myself  
- Clear write-ups explaining *what I did, how it works, and why it matters*

This repository will evolve as my skills evolve. Early commits may be basic. Later ones will be sharper. That progression is intentional and honest.

> Growth is visible here — commit by commit.

## How I Learn (My Approach)

My personal learning rules:

- Understand the **why**, not just the commands  
- Practice only in **legal and controlled environments**  
- Automate repetitive tasks whenever possible  
- Document everything clearly — including mistakes  

I’m building **real-world skills**, not shortcuts.

## Ethical Commitment ⚖️

I practice cybersecurity **strictly and responsibly**.

### I only work on:
- My own systems and virtual machines  
- Intentionally vulnerable platforms (Hack The Box, TryHackMe, VulnHub)  
- Systems where I have **explicit written permission**

### I will never:
- Access systems without authorization  
- Use these skills maliciously or illegally  
- Test real-world production systems without consent  
- Share exploits that could harm real users or infrastructure  

Ethics come before skills.
